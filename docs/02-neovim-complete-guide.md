## üéØ Daily Workflow Tips

### Morning Setup
```bash
# Start tmux session
tmux new-session -d -s dev

# Create panes
tmux split-window -h        # Split horizontally
tmux select-pane -t 0       # Select left pane
nvim                        # Start Neovim

# In right pane: claude, logs, tests
```

### Efficient Editing
1. **Use relative line numbers**: `:set rnu` for quick jumps
2. **Master dot command**: `.` repeats last change
3. **Use text objects**: `ciw` (change inner word), `di"` (delete in quotes)
4. **Combine commands**: `d3w` (delete 3 words), `y2j` (yank 2 lines down)

### Code Development Cycle
1. **Navigate**: `<leader>ff` ‚Üí find file
2. **Edit**: Use LSP commands (`gd`, `K`, `<leader>ca`)
3. **Test**: `<leader>h` ‚Üí horizontal terminal ‚Üí run tests
4. **Commit**: Use Claude Code for commit messages
