## üî• Challenge Exercises

### Challenge 1: Text Navigation Race
**Setup**: Open NEOVIM_LEARNING_GUIDE.md
**Goal**: Navigate to specific sections as fast as possible

```
Tasks:
1. Go to line 50 (:50)
2. Find "Visual Mode" section (/Visual Mode)
3. Jump to end of file (G)
4. Go back to top (gg)
5. Find the word "plugin" (*/plugin)

Time yourself! Goal: Under 30 seconds
```

### Challenge 2: Edit Like a Pro
**Setup**: Create a new file with some code
**Goal**: Make these edits efficiently

```
Starting text:
function getUserData() {
    let user = "john"
    let age = 25
    return user
}

Tasks:
1. Change "getUserData" to "getUser" (use cw on the word)
2. Add "Name" after "user" in the variable name
3. Delete the age line entirely (dd)
4. Add a new line with: let email = "john@example.com"
5. Change the return to: return {user, email}

Practice until you can do this in under 1 minute!
```

### Challenge 3: Search and Replace Master
**Setup**: Create a file with repeated text
**Goal**: Master find and replace

```
Starting text:
console.log("debug message 1")
console.log("debug message 2")
console.log("debug message 3")
let debug = true
if (debug) console.log("more debug")

Tasks:
1. Replace all "console.log" with "logger.info"
2. Replace all "debug" with "verbose"
3. Find all instances of "message" (use *)
4. Replace only the first "logger.info" with "console.warn"

:%s/debug/verbose/g
/message
:s/logger.info/console.warn/
```

## üß™ Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Code Review
**Setup**: Open a Python/JavaScript file
**Goal**: Navigate and understand code structure

```
Tasks:
1. Find all function definitions (/def or /function)
2. For each function:
   - Use gd to go to definition
   - Use K to see documentation
   - Use gr to find references
3. Navigate between functions using Ctrl-o and Ctrl-i
4. Use <leader>ca to see available code actions
```

### Scenario 2: Refactoring
**Setup**: Code with repeated variable names
**Goal**: Rename consistently

```
Example code:
let userData = fetchUser()
processUserData(userData)
saveUserData(userData)

Tasks:
1. Use gd on "userData" to see all instances
2. Use <leader>rn to rename "userData" to "user"
3. Verify all instances were changed
4. Use LSP to check for any errors
```

### Scenario 3: File Management
**Setup**: Project with multiple files
**Goal**: Efficient file navigation

```
Tasks:
1. Use <leader>ff to find a specific file
2. Open multiple files in buffers
3. Use <leader>fb to switch between buffers
4. Use oil.nvim (-) to browse filesystem
5. Create a new file from within oil.nvim
```

### Game 2: Edit Olympics
Time yourself doing these edits in sequence:
1. Insert "Hello" at start of line (I)
2. Append "World" at end (A)
3. Create new line below (o)
4. Delete the new line (dd)
5. Undo everything (u u u)
